# FPGA Project (EE2026 - Digital Design)

This repo contains source code for the FPGA Project of the EE2026 (Digital Design) module in our first year at NUS. The objective is to build a Sight and Sound Entertainment (SSE) system using Verilog, Digilent Basys 3 Board, Pmod OLEDrgb 96 x 64 RGB OLED Display, and Pmod MIC3.
