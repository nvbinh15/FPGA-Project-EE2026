# FPGA Project (EE2026 - Digital Design)

## Description
This repo contains source code for the FPGA Project of the EE2026 (Digital Design) module in our first year at NUS. We built a Sight and Sound Entertainment (SSE)
system including a Maze Soving game, a Shooting game (both with autoplay mode), and other objectives of processing audio data and visualization using Verilog.

## Hardware
* Digilent Basys 3 Board
* Pmod OLEDrgb 96 x 64 RGB OLED Display
* Pmod MIC3.

## Running
Connect the Pmod OLED Display and Pmod MIC to the Basys 3 Board and connect the board to your computer. Download the zip file and load it to the board with Xilinx Vivado IDE.
